# About this game
Player controls the fruit basket.  
The goal is to catch as many fresh fruits as possible.

As the game progresses, the difficulty level increases.  
For each fresh fruit caught, the player receives points. 
* Good apple: 5 points
* Good banana: 10 points
* Good pear: 10 points
* Good strawberry: 5 points

For each stale fruit caught, the player receives negative points.

* Bad apple: -5 points
* Bad banana: -10 points

The player has 3 hearts.  
If the player does not catch fresh fruit, he loses his heart.
