# About this game
Player controls the fruit basket.  
The goal is to catch as many fresh fruits as possible.  
As the game progresses, the difficulty level increases.  
For each fresh fruit caught, the player receives points.  
For each stale fruit caught, the player receives negative points.  
The player has 3 hearts.  
If the player does not catch fresh fruit, he loses his heart.  
When the player loses all hearts, the game ends.
